# ✅ Navigation Updates - Complete

## 🎯 Changes Made

I've streamlined the navigation by removing "Docs" from the header while keeping it accessible in the footer, and removed the CLI tool reference from the Documentation page.

## 📱 Header Navigation - UPDATED

### **Before:**
Product | Features | Case Studies | Blog | **Docs**

## 📂 Footer Navigation - UNCHANGED

Documentation is still accessible in the footer:

- **Documentation** ← Still here!

**Benefits:**

## 📚 Documentation Page - UPDATED

### **Quick Links Section:**

- Event System

**After (5 links):**
